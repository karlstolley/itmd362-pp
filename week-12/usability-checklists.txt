# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.https://stayintech.com/info/UX
2.http://www.studyweb.com/test-your-website-a-57-point-checklist-for-maximum-usability/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:
1. website has enough white space for the user (at least half of the screen)
2. simple navigation method so the user can easily understand and use
3. website is compatible with many different browsers and versions
4. typography fits the overall purpose and design of the website
5. include minimal motion graphics (don't overdo "cool" things)
6. website should be low-bandwith friendly
7. color of the website is not eye-blinding 
8. layout is set up so that important things that user would visit for is highlighted with visual queues
9. make the design flow, control the path the user's eyes follow
10. keep the design of the website consistant across all the different pages
