# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: The usual wear-and-tear of the watch is visible. (more visible in person)
Made out of stainless steel, it has a timeless design that will age well into the future.

* Behavioral: The watch does one thing and that is telling me the date/time in a somewhat of a 
traditional/old way with analog clock face.

* Reflective: This is the single most important object that I own.
This is an "heirloom" (atleast will be) that my father used before he passed. 
This watch reminds me of him every time I check the time.
It reminds me when my father told me to use this watch starting college.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. In the watch world, this watch has a small watch face which is a quality similar to "white-spaces" in web design.
   The main purpose of a watch is to tell time. However, that does not justify making the watch face huge to
   cover-up everything but the time it's telling.
2. Design of this watch is consistant. You can go around the whole watch including the wrist-strap
   and still will be able to tell that it's one solid thing. 
   (Which is a contrast from watches with medal face and leather strap for example. 
   While still well-designed potentially more elegant and unique, design is less consistant and at times, 
   even experimental and odd looking)
3. This watch is simple to put on and easy to use. I will try to make the website in a way that feels like
   the simplest thing such as putting of a watch on your wrist and easy to use as if you just have to look
   at it to use it.
