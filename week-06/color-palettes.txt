# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: #FF0303
Palette UID: 1000u0kvGCbjBINpaElC5scEJm1
Explanation of your color choices: I chose this red color because I know red sticks out to most people and catches their
	eye. So if I was a high end gaming company I would want my products to be noticed.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: #0F66BA
Palette UID: 53-0u0kvGCbjBINpaElC5scEJm1
Explanation of your color choices: I chose this blue color shade because I wanted to represent
	the organic color choice which I feel this blue incorporates well.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: #059DB2 and #FF7C03
Palette UID: 23l0u0kvGCbjBINpaElC5scEJm1
Explanation of your color choices: I think the lighter color choice I chose has a war welcoming feeling to them, which 
	banks would like to customers to feel they are at home when handling their finances.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename:#02C16F, #FFD003, #870ABD
Palette UID: 333180kvGCbjBINpaElC5scEJm1
Explanation of your color choices: The fun lighter color choice I chose would attract the interest of parents and children alike.
	Alot of children's games already have this lighter color feel, and I think this would be a good choice to follow those lines.
