# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices:palette one was chosen with the only reference that I have to modern video games: “HALO” I am not a gamer, but whenever I think about gaming laptops or similar I think about this game, also it makes a reference to the classic view of the command prompt with black background and green letters

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: for organic foods I choose a different kind of green, more “earthy” greens. This decision I made just because most vegetables are green, and most organic product are vegetables, I think. 

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: this was the most difficult selection cause I am aware that I can cause tension with this. However my selection was so that user feels comfortable, and friendly.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Explanation of your color choices:This colors I chose thinking about a baby more than a toddler. I think this colors will grave the attention of a baby without generating stress.
